OVERVIEW

This repository contains scripts and resources from a rotation project focused on:

• Inferring the animal origin of the investigated parchments.

• Elucidating the microbiome colonizing the parchment fragments.

The project leverages shotgun metagenomics data generated from an Illumina MiniSeq instrument. The dataset includes:

• Ten non-destructively sampled parchments (brush/rubbings).

• One negative control sample

GOALS

• Species Identification: Identify the animal species contributing to the parchment material using bioinformatics tools.

• Microbial Analysis: Analyze and characterize the microbial communities present on the parchment fragments.
